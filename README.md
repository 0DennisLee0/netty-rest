Netty RESTful Server
=======
Netty-rest is a high performance HTTP and WebSocket server implementation based on Netty. It uses `javax.ws.rs` annotations and generates lambdas at runtime in order to provide best performance.

You can take a look at examples in Rakam project which uses netty-rest: https://github.com/rakam-io/rakam/blob/master/rakam/src/main/java/org/rakam/plugin/user/UserHttpService.java
